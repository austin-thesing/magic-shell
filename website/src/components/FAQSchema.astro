        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, Magic Shell is completely free and open-source under the MIT license. It supports free AI models through OpenCode Zen (including big-pickle, glm-4.7, minimax-m2.1, and kimi-k2.5) as well as premium models from various providers.

      "name": "What AI providers does Magic Shell support?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Magic Shell supports OpenCode Zen (recommended, with free models), OpenRouter, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. You can also add custom models from LM Studio, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API. Each provider offers different models with varying capabilities and pricing."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does the safety system work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Magic Shell analyzes every command for potential risks before execution. Commands are categorized into severity levels (low, medium, high, critical). Critical commands like 'rm -rf /' or fork bombs are always blocked. You can configure safety levels: strict (confirm all risky commands), moderate (confirm high severity), or relaxed (minimal confirmations). The system uses pattern matching, privilege detection, and path analysis to identify dangerous operations."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What's the difference between msh and mshell commands?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "msh is the quick CLI mode for one-shot command translations. Use it like 'msh \"find large files\"' to get a command, or 'msh -x \"show disk usage\"' to execute directly. mshell launches the full interactive TUI mode with themes, command history, model switching, and keyboard shortcuts. TUI mode is recommended for extended sessions and exploration."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes! Magic Shell supports custom models from LM Studio, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Run 'msh --add-model' to configure a custom model with your local server URL. This allows you to use Magic Shell completely offline with locally-hosted models."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What platforms does Magic Shell support?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Magic Shell works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It automatically detects your shell (bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, CMD, Nushell, or POSIX sh) and adapts command syntax accordingly. Credentials are securely stored using your system's native keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret, or Windows Credential Manager)."

      "name": "How do I switch between different AI models?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "In CLI mode, use 'msh --model <model-id>' to set the default model. In TUI mode, press Ctrl+X M to open the model selector and switch between available models on the fly. You can also switch providers with 'msh --provider <name>' or Ctrl+X S in TUI mode. Run 'msh --models' to see all available models."
