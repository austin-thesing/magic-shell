title: Your First Command
description: Learn the basics of using Magic Shell to translate natural language to terminal commands.
---

import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Now that you have Magic Shell installed and configured, let's try your first command!

## Basic Usage

Simply describe what you want to do in plain English:

```bash
msh "find all JavaScript files"
```

Magic Shell will translate this and show you the command:

```
find . -name "*.js"
```

## Execution Modes

### Print Only (Default)

By default, Magic Shell prints the command without executing it:

```bash
msh "show disk usage"
# Output: df -h
```

### Execute Immediately

Use the `-x` flag to execute the command directly:

```bash
msh -x "show current directory"
# Executes: pwd
```

<Aside type="caution">
  The `-x` flag executes commands immediately. Always review the command in the output before using `-x` on unfamiliar queries.
</Aside>

### Dry Run with Safety Analysis

Use `-n` to see the command with a full safety analysis:

```bash
msh -n "delete all node_modules folders"
```

This shows:
- The translated command
- Safety severity level
- Why it was flagged (if applicable)
- Whether confirmation is required

## Interactive Mode

For a richer experience, launch the TUI:

```bash
msh -i
# or just
msh
```

In TUI mode you can:
- Type queries naturally
- See command history
- Change models on the fly
- Toggle dry-run mode
- Switch themes

## Example Queries

Here are some things you can ask Magic Shell:

### File Operations
```bash
msh "find files larger than 100MB"
msh "count lines of code in this project"
msh "show the 10 most recently modified files"
msh "compress this folder to a zip file"
```

### Git Operations
```bash
msh "undo my last commit but keep changes"
msh "show commits from the last week"
msh "create a branch called feature-login"
msh "what files changed in the last commit"
```

### System Operations
```bash
msh "what process is using port 3000"
msh "show memory usage"
msh "list all running docker containers"
msh "check if nginx is running"
```

### Network
```bash
msh "download this file" # followed by URL
msh "what's my IP address"
msh "test if google.com is reachable"
```

## Tips

<Steps>
1. **Be specific**: "find large files" is good, "find files larger than 100MB in the downloads folder" is better.

2. **Mention your context**: "in this git repo" or "in the current directory" helps Magic Shell generate more accurate commands.

3. **Use dry run first**: When trying something new, use `-n` to review the command and its safety analysis.

4. **Check the model**: Different models have different strengths. Use `Ctrl+X M` in TUI to switch models.
</Steps>

## Next Steps

- Learn about [AI providers](/features/providers/) and which models to use
- Understand the [safety system](/features/safety-levels/) that protects you
- Explore [TUI mode](/features/tui-mode/) features and shortcuts
