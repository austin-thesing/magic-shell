title: Your First Command
description: Learn the basics of using Magic Shell to translate natural language to terminal commands.

import { Aside, Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Now that you have Magic Shell installed and configured, let's try your first command!

## Choose Your Mode

Magic Shell offers two ways to work:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TUI Mode">
    Launch the interactive terminal interface:

    ```bash
    mshell
    ```

    The TUI gives you:
    - A persistent interface for multiple queries
    - Command history and context
    - Live model and theme switching
    - Safety analysis display
    - Keyboard shortcuts for everything

    Simply type your query and press Enter. The translated command appears with safety info, ready to execute or copy.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="CLI Mode">
    For quick one-off translations:

    ```bash
    msh "find all JavaScript files"
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    find . -name "*.js"
    ```

    Use `-x` to execute directly:
    ```bash
    msh -x "show disk usage"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## TUI Workflow

<Steps>
1. Launch with `mshell`
2. Type your query in natural language
3. Review the translated command and safety analysis
4. Press Enter to execute, or use keyboard shortcuts to copy/modify
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  The TUI remembers your command history across sessions, making it easy to refine and re-run previous queries.
</Aside>

## CLI Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `msh "query"` | Translate and print |
| `msh -x "query"` | Translate and execute |
| `msh -n "query"` | Dry run with safety analysis |

<Aside type="caution">
  The `-x` flag executes commands immediately. Use `-n` first on unfamiliar queries to review the safety analysis.
</Aside>

## Example Queries

Try these in either mode:

### File Operations
- "find files larger than 100MB"
- "count lines of code in this project"
- "show the 10 most recently modified files"

### Git Operations
- "undo my last commit but keep changes"
- "show commits from the last week"
- "what files changed in the last commit"

### System Operations
- "what process is using port 3000"
- "show memory usage"
- "list all running docker containers"

## Tips

<Steps>
1. **Be specific**: "find files larger than 100MB in downloads" is better than "find large files"

2. **Use TUI for exploration**: The interactive mode makes it easy to refine queries and see history

3. **Check safety analysis**: Commands are analyzed for risk before execution

4. **Switch models**: Different models have different strengths. Use `Ctrl+X M` in TUI to switch
</Steps>

## Next Steps

- Explore [TUI mode](/features/tui-mode/) features and shortcuts
- Learn about [AI providers](/features/providers/) and which models to use
- Understand the [safety system](/features/safety-levels/) that protects you
